🚀 Main Contributions:
- we explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity .
- we use nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean- field theory .
- in this regime matter and light equilibrate at dis- tinct—and in some cases opposite—effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization .
- a two-dimensional square lattice of N Rydberg- dressed atoms is situated inside a single-mode optical cavity [71–73], as depicted in Fig.
