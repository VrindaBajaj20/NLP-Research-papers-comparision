🚀 Main Contributions:
- our study targets the [C ii] luminosity function (LF) at high redshift, which is still highly uncertain, in particular at the faint end .
- we present forecasts for eventual 10 wider and/or 10 more sensitive surveys .
- LIM records the cumulative sig- nal from all sources including the contribution from the faintest galaxies that are missed in traditional flux-limited surveys .
- it was first proposed to study the epoch of cosmic reionisation through the 21cm hyperfine line of atomic hydrogen .
- fervid forecasting endeavour provided the basis for developing about thirty dedicated instruments1 for LIM from the ground, balloon based, and from space .
