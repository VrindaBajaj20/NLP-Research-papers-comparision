🚀 Main Contributions:
- In this work, we experimentally demonstrated reso- nant dipolar interactions between Rydberg Rb atoms and KRb molecules in an optical dipole trap (ODT) and developed a quantitative model to explain our ob- servations.
- This work provides an experimental demonstration and measurement of resonant dipolar interactions be- tween ultracold Rydberg atoms and polar molecules, paving the way for realizing hybrid systems for quan- tum computation and simulation.
- This work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES), under Award No.
